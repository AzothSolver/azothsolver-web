## Abstract

AzothSolver is a performance-focused solver implementation for CoW Protocol, built with Frankfurt-based bare metal infrastructure and optimized for sub-5 millisecond execution latency. This document outlines the system’s technical architecture, development approach, and roadmap toward integration with CoW Protocol's shadow competition environment in Q4 2025.

## 1. Technical Challenge

CoW Protocol's batch auction system creates a competitive environment where solver performance directly impacts settlement efficiency and user outcomes. Success requires optimizing these key areas:

- **Infrastructure Latency**: Network round-trip time to CoW Protocol infrastructure significantly impacts bid submission timing and settlement opportunities.
- **Routing Efficiency**: Advanced pathfinding algorithms that can identify optimal settlement paths within the auction's time constraints.
- **System Reliability**: Consistent performance under varying network conditions and order volumes.

## 2. Technical Implementation

### Infrastructure Architecture

- **Location**: Frankfurt-based bare metal server optimized for < 5ms latency to CoW Protocol endpoints.
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04 with real-time kernel patches for predictable scheduling.
- **Networking**: DPDK-based packet processing with kernel bypass for reduced latency variance.
- **Node Setup**: Local node infrastructure for direct blockchain state access and transaction broadcasting.

### Software Stack

- **Core Language**: Rust for performance-critical components with memory safety guarantees.
- **Pathfinding**: Custom graph algorithms optimized for CoW Protocol's batch auction constraints.
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive telemetry for latency analysis and performance optimization.
- **Testing**: Extensive simulation framework for algorithm validation before deployment.

## 3. Development Team

AzothSolver is being developed by an experienced infrastructure engineer with a background in high-performance systems:

- **Lead Developer**: Self-taught engineer with previous experience building and operating large-scale crypto mining infrastructure, cross-chain messaging protocols, and Web3 educational curricula for European institutions.
- **Approach**: Solo development with focus on deep technical understanding and iterative improvement based on real performance data.
