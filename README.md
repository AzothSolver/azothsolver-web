## 🧬 About AzothSolver

**AzothSolver** is a performance-optimized solver architecture built specifically for CoW Protocol’s batch auction system. Its design emphasizes:

- ⚙️ **Low-latency Infrastructure**: Hosted in a latency-leveraged location near CoW Protocol core infrastructure, using DPDK networking and real-time kernel optimizations for sub-5ms auction response times.
- 🧮 **Efficient Algorithms**: Custom Rust-based pathfinding tailored to CoW Protocol’s auction mechanics.
- 📊 **Transparency & Observability**: Real-time metrics via Prometheus and Grafana, with public updates on [X (@AzothSolver)](https://x.com/AzothSolver).

📄 For in-depth specifications, see the [AzothSolver Whitepaper (PDF)](/assets/documents/AzothSolver-Whitepaper.pdf).
